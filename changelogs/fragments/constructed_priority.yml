minor_changes:
  - The ``Constructed`` base class (and plugin) no has a ``vars`` key in the ``keyed_groups`` option, so users can add vars directly w/o need of a 2nd inventory or vars plugin or guessing group names.
  - The ``constructed`` inventory plugin also now can have an option ``group_vars`` to allow for assiging vars to groups w/o the need of a 2nd inventory or vars plugin.
