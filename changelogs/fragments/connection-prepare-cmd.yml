minor_changes:
- >-
  connection - Added new method to connection plugins called ``prepare_command``. This method can be used by connection
  plugins to have finer control over how the command is built to match the connection plugins implementation. The
  default behaviour on how commands are constructed remains unchanged.
bugfixes:
- psrp - Support setting ``chdir`` with ``script`` when using the ``psrp`` connection plugin - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81277
